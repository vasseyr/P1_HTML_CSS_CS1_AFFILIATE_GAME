<p target=Overview>Overview</p>

This website was created to bring together some of the highest rated games of skill and chance for users who need an immersive experience while trying to change their odds. 

User Story

Daniel is an ordinary guy. He works long hours and looks after his family and really enjoys letting off some steam by gambling, something about the indsutry has caught his imagination and he really enjoys the feeling of being a high roller even if hes not betting huge amounts. He does not spend a whole lot of money on gambling but he does enjoy games that are highly rated that have been developed well. The challenge he faces is the time it takes to find these games as hes not 100% sure where to always look, alot of his time that he could be using to play the games he likes he needs to look for them. 

This why we created Affiliate Games. Our team seek out the most highly rated games within the vendors we work with and are able to regularly place the games these vendors host with the highest rating on our site, we are the one stop site for all high level gaming needs. 

<p target=>What's Been Built</p>

The website is primarily a page of links to games from other vendors and creators who have trouble getting exposure or want to increase their customer base through other avenues. Also for people who want to take part in gambling and betting activity where they can access the best top rated games and connect with like-minded individuals with a shared view of changing the odds within their lives.

The website consists of 4 pages which tell the user:
1. What we do and how it works
2. Contact us
3. List of links to games 
4. And a signup page to register interest in having your games displayed

The website is built using HTML and CSS. Some media queries will be used to generate responsiveness on different devices.

In the future, it is envisioned that the signup page will lead to a checkout where legal documents will be generated and potelial clients can make an initial payment to become an affiliate, also an ability for users to sign up and get alerts to be notified of when a new game has been added to the network. 

Affiliates get paid for the traffic they bring to casino websites. There are several different models of rewarding the affiliates. 1) Revenue-share. With this model, affiliates get a percentage of the casino's net revenue generated by referred players.
